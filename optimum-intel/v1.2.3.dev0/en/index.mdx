<h1 id="optimum-intel">Optimum Intel</h1>

ðŸ¤— Optimum Intel is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

[Intel Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) is an open-source library enabling the usage of the most popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies in order for users to easily generate quantized model. The users can easily apply static, dynamic and aware-training quantization approaches while giving an expected accuracy criteria. It also supports different weight pruning techniques enabling the creation of pruned model giving a predefined sparsity target.
